# Fizz Buzz tree
# Challenge Summary
- Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

## Challenge Description
- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
- - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- - If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
Return the new tree.
- ## Approach & Efficiency
- 
## Big (O)
- Binary Tree : Time --> O(n), Space --> O(n)

- fizzBuzzTree :
- Time --> O(n) :we have to iterate every node
- Space --> O(n) :creating some nodes
