# Tree Intersection
  - Find common values in 2 binary trees.

# Challenge
 - Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
 - Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

# Approach & Efficiency
  - function that take two trees as an argument  and return a set of values found in both trees.

# Big O 
  - Time O(n)
  - Space O(1)
