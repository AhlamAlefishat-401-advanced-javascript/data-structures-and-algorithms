## Challenge Description
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments.

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Using class node as a module.
- Acces to all linked list properties.
