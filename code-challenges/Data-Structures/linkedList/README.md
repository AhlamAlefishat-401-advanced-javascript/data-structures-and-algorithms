# Singly Linked List


## Challenge:
- Create a Node class that has 2 properties (value / next)
- LinkedList class, include a head property --> inside this class :
- - insert() method to insert a node onto the head of the linked list
- - includes() method to see if a specific value in the linked list
- - toString() method to return string representing all the values in the Linked List formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

- - .append(value) method  which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- - .insertBefore(value, newVal) ,ethod which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
- - .insertAfter(value, newVal) method  which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

- - Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. 

## Approach & Efficiency
- *The approach*
- two classes
-  while loop
- if statment
- *The Big O space/time for this approach*
- O(n)
