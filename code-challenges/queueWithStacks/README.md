# Challenge Summary
## Queue with Stacks
## Implement a Queue using two Stacks

## Challenge Description
### Implement a Queue using two Stacks


## Approach & Efficiency
### Create a brand new PseudoQueue class.Do not use an existing Queue.Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods enqueue and dequeue), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.
### enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
### dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.


## Big (O)
O(1)
