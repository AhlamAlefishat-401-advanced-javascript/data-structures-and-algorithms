# Hash Table Implementation

## Challenge Summary
- Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:
1. add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
2. get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3. contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
4. hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

### Approach & Efficiency
- Classes are used with while loop and if condition.

### Big O
- Time: O(1) :
- Space: O(n) :
