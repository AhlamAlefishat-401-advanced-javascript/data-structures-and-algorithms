# Challenge Summary
## Implementation: Stacks and Queues

## Challenge Description
Stacks: is a data structure that consists of Nodes.FILO(First In Last Out).
Queues: is a liner data structure or FIFO(First In First Out
## Approach & Efficiency
- Create class Node: - Stacks
- Create class Stack that have their common terminology:
- push(value): adds a new node with that value to the top.
- pop(): removes the node from the top of the stack.
- peek(): returns the value of the node located on top of the stack.
- isEmpty(): returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty. - Queues
- Create class Queue that have their common terminology:
- enqueue(value): adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue.
- dequeue(): removes the node from the front of the queue.
- peek(): returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue.
- isEmpty(): returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.
